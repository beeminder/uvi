SAVING UP FOR POST-6.2 BEEMIOS
* https://github.com/beeminder/BeeSwift/pull/330 -- possibly made autofetching faster or more reliable or less resource-intensive?
* 2022-12-21: https://github.com/beeminder/BeeSwift/pull/359 -- iOS 16 introduces support for more granular sleep tracking, with different levels of sleep. Apple Watch records this data when worn during sleep. These levels do not match the filter we were using for sleep analysis data, so Apple Watch users would not see any sleep data. Here we also count these periods as sleeping on new iOS.
* [2023-ish] This adds a confirmation screen to the flow for adding an apple health metric. This screen
 - Allows for a preview of the data which will be added for the metric and information about the unit.
 - In the future will allow additional configuration settings.
  https://github.com/beeminder/BeeSwift/pull/364
* Previously when syncing healthkit datapoints to the server data, we would always fetch exactly 7 server points. This would go badly if there were multiple points for a day on the server, and didn't support adding features where we synced more history. Here we instead estimate the number of points to fetch from the server, and fetch more until we have confirmed we have enough.
  https://github.com/beeminder/BeeSwift/pull/366
* Make the UI look a little cleaner by lining up various elements and making the spacing more consistent.
  https://github.com/beeminder/BeeSwift/pull/367
BEEMIOS AGAIN
Reduce wall clock time spend during background updates (PR #374)
* iOS applies some complex logic to decide how often to allow apps to run background updates. The rules are opaque, but potentially include the app's energy use. To try to maximize the chance of beeminder waking up to update goals and badges, here we change background processesing to complete as quickly as possible
* For background updates, do work as quickly as possible For healthkit observers report as soon as we are done, even on failure.
* Stand hours autodata metric now accurate (as accurate as Apple is).
* Gallery now sorted by countdown + pledge + goalname
* Respect timey-ness: https://github.com/beeminder/BeeSwift/issues/233

* This largely rewrites how we aggregate metrics for category data types. There is a base implementation, and an entirely separate implementation for time asleep.
  https://github.com/beeminder/BeeSwift/pull/362
  - For most metrics (Time In Bed, Meditation Minutes, etc), we now look at total non-overlapping time. This avoids double counting with multiple data sources.
  - For sleep we do a complex attribution process looking at both asleep and awake samples, and disagreements between multiple data sources. This isn't quite right for cases with multiple inputs (e.g. Oura and Apple Watch) but is much closer than the previous implementation. The calculation function is moderately covered by unit tests.
* Send badge update to ios when eep_count changes. We do this by sending a badge update whenever a goal goes from emergency to non-emergency or backwards.

BEEDROID

google auth?
push notifications?
BEEDROID
Adjust Android Firebase messages (PR #4103)
* This stops sending a direct notification. We can't get the IDs on the Android app that we need when we send a direct notification.
* This sends a "multiuser" title down, too, in case there are multiple accounts logged into the Android app.
* This refactors the android_push_notification method on Goal and puts it on AndroidNotification instead. I removed "delay_while_idle" as it has been ignored by Google for ~5 years. I added a "now_safe" to the goal_push_options, to generate Now Safe notifications on the Android side. I removed the collapse key because we should only have a total of four per user max, and there's no limit to how many folks can sign into one Android app. I added the slug for the goal that triggered the goal push notification as well.
* This removes the emoji header, and adds a countdown time for emergency day notifications.
For #896.
--
Add Android Notification config page (PR #4110)
This will eventually be a UVI.
It works better on small screens, and has some extra CSS.
This is gated behind beeta_features[:beedroid_push].
For #4109.
This is maybe a UVI?
* UVI: get a little popup that says you can't add a widget before logging into Beeminder.
* The Android checkboxes are centered, and the goal names are right justified, which helps things if you have really long goal names and a small phone screen.
  It adjusts some spacing.

[SCHEDEL]
adam called this stale resque workers thing an infra but maybe we could call it user-visible if we can find a way to describe it:
Resque workers could be stale after deploy because our way of restarting them wasn't pointing at the PIDs of the workers themselves, but of the wrapper that started them up

[QUESTIONABLE][SCHEDEL]
we introduced a syntax error on Jan 5th that turned a "422" error to a "500" error response.
questionable because it's an error that's returned to some javascript on our pages, so was already an error response and probably the difference in 422 vs 500 didn't change how it was handled / what it looked like from the user's POV.
