Well we pushed it until they actually stopped delivering (some?) notifications from the old API, resulting in stale safety buffers and graph colors, as well as missed alerts, for some users. So we hurry-up finished the switch to the new API. Also, per Adam, something about 'push notification token closer to Google guidelines'. Specifically, we used to only update our server with the device's notification ID if it changed from what we thought it used to be -- now, we just send it to our server no matter what and handle it on the server. PS: It might be a bit more complicated in terms of what parts were server-side vs app-side; see the gissue notes.",
